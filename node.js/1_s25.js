there are 3 datatypes 

var , const, let

var is used to take variables we can also take input of string but car is mutable and for operations
var is used only for old browsers i.e browsers before 2015
const is used to take characters/strings and also those data which shouldnt change for fixed type of data

we can directly use node in  terminal by writing node.....
but we dont do bcz after closing terminal it will erase our code
